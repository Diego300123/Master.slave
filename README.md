---- Exercice 1
# We are going to create the files vagrantfile and .gitignore and configure .gitignore to ignore changes in the .vagrant and backup files as requested by the exercise.

# Finally I will also create the README file to document the exercises I am doing and the LICENSE file with a license of my choice.

---- Exercice 2

#We put the necessary instructions in the vagrantfile to create the two virtual machines (venus and tierra) with their respective IP addresses.

#Finally we do "vagrant up" to create the Virtual Machines.

---- Exercice 3

# For section 1, 2 and 3 we will have to configure the named.conf.options file, to do this we will copy it outside, modify it and then copy it to the machine again.

# For section 4 we will have to modify some files of the tierra machine to make it a master system.

# For section 5 we will have to modify some files of the venus machine to make it a slave system.
